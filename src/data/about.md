# Intro

I am a Junior software engineer currently working at Amazon. In my spare time, you probably going to to find me gaming. I have an idea of going into indie game and want to build this website to document my experience(in fact, just in case this idea is forgotten and I can give more attention to it). If you think anything is useful here or would like to get in touch with me, feel free to ask or chat about anything!


# But How?

I often have weird dreams. I'd like to take it as a starting point, and build out something that replicate my dream.
